**License:**

Engine can be used for free for personal non-commercial purpose only. Any purpose, that involves explicit or implicit revenue, including indirect one (in case of budget or government organizations, educational purposes, etc.) - is allowed only after buying commercial license.

Any form of reverse-engineering is forbidden, including but not limited to debugging, decompiling, disassembling.

**License philosophy:**

Programmers should be professionals, not just enthusiasts, who have to provide unrelated services in order to earn money. If one uses my work to earn money - then he should share part of his revenue with me. If you earn money via clogging nails, then why do you think hammer should be free for you? Buy it! I've put my effort into making tool for you to earn money. And it's like law of energy conservation. Every drop of sweat should pay off.
